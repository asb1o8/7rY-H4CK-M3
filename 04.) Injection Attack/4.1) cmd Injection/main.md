## Command Injection

- Command Injection is a vulnerability that occurs when an attacker manipulates input fields to inject malicious commands into
  a vulnerable application. This can lead to unauthorised execution of arbitrary commands on the targeted server, potentially
  resulting in data breaches, system compromise, or unintended operations
- Command injection is the abuse of an application's behaviour to execute commands on the operating system, using the same
  privileges that the application on a device is running with. For example, achieving command injection on a web server running
  as a user named joe will execute commands under this joe user - and therefore obtain any permissions that joe has.

- Command injection is also often known as “Remote Code Execution” (RCE) because of the ability to remotely execute code within
  an application. These vulnerabilities are often the most lucrative to an attacker because it means that the attacker can
  directly interact with the vulnerable system. For example, an attacker may read system or user files, data, and things of
  that nature.

- For example, being able to abuse an application to perform the command whoami to list what user account the application is
  running will be an example of command injection.
