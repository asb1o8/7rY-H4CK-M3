## ☁Cloud Computing💻

- Cloud computing is the perfect solution for the challenges in the application you’ve designed, such as moving your files from a single laptop to online storage
  that you can access anywhere. Instead of running your app on one computer in one country, the cloud lets you use computing resources over the internet.

#### ☁ Evolution from Server to Cloud:-

#### ☁ Cloud Benefits and Characteristics:-

The cloud was designed to address common problems, including limited capacity, high costs, and slow growth. Following arecthe benefits and characteristics:
- Scalability: Easily scale up or down as your application's needs change.
- On-demand self-service: Create or remove servers and storage instantly, without waiting for hardware.
- Pay only for what you use: You are charged based on usage, not upfront costs.
- Security: Cloud providers protect the infrastructure with strong security measures.
- High availability: Applications keep running even if part of the system fails.
- Global access: Your application can be accessed by users anywhere in the world.


#### ☁ Types of Cloud:- 
The deployment types you can choose for a cloud environment:
- ##### Public Cloud:
  It is used by startups, websites, and global apps because it is affordable, easy to scale, and requires no infrastructure management. Public cloud services
  are preferable for nearly every use case.
- ##### Private Cloud:
  It is used by banks, healthcare, and government organizations because it offers greater control, customization, and compliance for sensitive data.
- ##### Hybrid Cloud:
  It is used by companies like e-commerce platforms that need to keep sensitive data private while still scaling publicly during high demand.


#### ☁ Cloud Service Models:-
- ##### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
  You rent basic computing resources such as virtual servers, storage, and networking. You are responsible for managing the operating system and your application,cwhile the provider manages the physical hardware.
- ##### Platform as a Service (PaaS):
  The cloud provider manages the infrastructure and the operating system. You focus on building, deploying, and running your application without worrying about
  servers.
- ##### Software as a Service (SaaS):
  You use a complete application over the internet. The provider manages everything, and you access the software through a browser or app, for example, Gmail or
  Zoom.


#### ☁ Major Cloud Vendors:-

- `Microsoft Azure`: A strong competitor, especially in enterprise and hybrid cloud environments.
- `Google Cloud Platform (GCP)`: Known for powerful data analytics, AI, and machine learning tools.
- `Alibaba Cloud`: A major player in Asia, offering competitive cloud services globally.
- `IBM Cloud`: Focuses on hybrid cloud and AI-driven solutions for businesses.
- `Oracle Cloud`: Focuses on enterprise applications and databases.


### ☁ How Companies are using the Cloud:-
- `Netflix` runs its entire platform on AWS so it can scale globally, stay online during peak demand, and stream content reliably to millions of users at once.
- `Spotify` uses the cloud to handle millions of songs and users, scaling quickly when new music or features are released.
- `Instagram` relies on the cloud to store massive amounts of photos and videos and deliver them fast to users around the world.
- `Online stores` use the cloud to handle traffic spikes during black friday without buying permanent infrastructure.


### ☁ Basic Cloud Terminology:-
- `EC2 (Virtual Computer / Server)`: EC2 represents a virtual computer in the cloud. Just like a real computer, it has a CPU and memory (RAM) and can run applications. Whenever you add an EC2 instance, you are adding a computer to your environment.
- `Instance Type (for example: t2, t3, m5)`: Instance types describe how powerful the virtual computer is. Some have more CPU and RAM and are therefore more expensive. You choose the Instance Type based on your needs, knowing that:
  
  - Bigger instances = more power + higher cost
  - Minor instances = less power + lower cost


Let's quickly review some concepts we learned in this room:

- `Public Cloud`: Cloud services you access over the internet that many people and companies share.
- `Private Cloud`: A cloud built just for one company, so they have more control and security.
- `Hybrid Cloud`: A mix of public and private clouds that can work together and share data.
- `IaaS`: A service where you rent basic computer parts like servers and storage from the cloud.
- `PaaS`: A service that gives you a ready-to-use environment to build and run apps without managing servers.
- `SaaS`: Software you use online without installing anything, like Gmail or Zoom.
- `EC2`: Amazon’s cloud computers that you can quickly create, use, and resize whenever you need them.

We also concluded that the key benefits of cloud computing are:

    Scalability
    On-demand self-service
    Pay only for what you use
    Security
    High availability
    Global access
