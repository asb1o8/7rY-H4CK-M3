## IAAA- Identity, Authentication, Authorisation, & Accountability


#### 🌲 Following categories are covered:
- A01: Broken Access Control
- A07: Authentication Failures
- A09: Logging & Alerting Failures


##### ✨ IAAA is a simple way to think about how users and their actions are verified on applications. Each item plays a crucial role and it isn't possible to skip a level. That means, if a previous item isn't being performed, you cannot perform the later times. The four items are:

- Identity - the unique account (e.g., user ID/email) that represents a person or service.
- Authentication - proving that identity (passwords, OTP, passkeys).
- Authorisation - what that identity is allowed to do.
- Accountability - recording and alerting on who did what, when, and from where.

###### 🔑 Weaknesses here can be incredibly detrimental, as it can allow threat actors to either access the data of other users or Privilege Escalation
